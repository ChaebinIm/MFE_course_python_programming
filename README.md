# MFE_course_python_programming
###### It's the contents about the lecture called "Python Programming" in KAIST MFE course.

###### In this course, you can read python source codes using Python, especially the library called "Pandas".
###### As most people know, in the field of analyzing some datasets, Python is really popular. And it seems that using pandas greatly is essential to analyze data with python. So I studied Python(Pandas) in this repository. I used so many data sets, and so many methods to process the data. Especially, data preprocessing with pandas is really time-consuming and if you want to work at the field of data analysis, you have to do it easily. I did it on this repository. It was a little bit hard, but thanks to this problems, I could have been more and more great at data processing. I'm really proud of myself.

##### Here ars some tips. There are so many important functions in pandas. 
1. When you process time-series data, you may have to know how to use the function "resample". It can arrange time series data so easily just with one line of source code. 
2. if you want to categorize a series into some classes, you can use the function "cut". 
3. Additionally, you can use the function called "apply" when you want to change the data of each cell with a given condition. 
###### I really used much the functions "resample" and "apply" even with other projects. So if you want to know just 2 functions of these source codes, I recommend to remember these 2 functions. They are really valuable. 


###### I think it's enough to introduce this repository because the detail is really complicated, so you have to read the source code liens to understand the all functions. If you want to read the source codes, at first, you can just read the pdf to understand what the problem is. And after it, you can read source code because the pdf file would help you to understand the source code more easily.
